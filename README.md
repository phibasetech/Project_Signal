> "Finding the Signal in the Noise: An AI-Powered, Open-Source Solution to the ‘Information Overload’ Crisis"

This repository contains the official open-source prototype for **Project Signal**, a free, AI-powered dApp designed to filter the chaos of the digital world and deliver personalized, actionable insights.

This project is based on the [Project Signal Whitepaper](link) (link to your whitepaper here).

## The Problem: Information Overload
We are drowning in a high-velocity, low-quality firehose of data. AI-generated "noise" has buried the remaining "signal," making it impossible to find wisdom.

## The Solution: A Personal AI Analyst
"Signal" is a dApp that securely understands your unique context (professional field, hobbies, financial interests) and scans the digital landscape to deliver a feed of distilled, high-value insights.

### Core Features (V1.0)

* **Open-Source for Trust:** In a world of "black box" AI, trust is everything. Our code is fully auditable.
* **"Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK):** Our V1.0 model is decentralized and free. By allowing users to plug in their own API keys (e.g., YouTube, Twitter, Etherscan), we remove the data-cost burden and make the tool censorship-resistant.
* **Interchangeable Models:** The AI Engine is built on a series of interchangeable Python modules to find specific types of signals (e.g., YouTube distillation, on-chain "Key Actor" tracking, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Use This Prototype

This is a **non-functional prototype** designed to showcase the project's architecture.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Project-Signal.git](https://github.com/your-username/Project-Signal.git)
    cd Project-Signal
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configure the "BYOK" model:**
    * Copy `config.ini.example` to `config.ini`.
    * Edit `config.ini` and add your (future) API keys. This file is ignored by git.
4.  **Run the main engine (prototype):**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will run a simulated loop that "scans" for signals and prints fake, high-value signals (based on the scenarios in our whitepaper) to your console.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (V1.0):** The Open-Source Foundation (This repository).
* **Phase 2 (V1.5):** The "Phibase Pro" hosted service for enterprise users.
* **Phase 3 (V2.0):** The "Signal" Protocol, a fully decentralized, community-governed network.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
This project is being built as a public good. We are actively seeking community support and funding.
